// BlazeDb cross-tab notification module.
// The writer tab posts a message after each checkpoint; replica tabs listen and reload.
// BroadcastChannel only carries the signal - the data itself always travels through storage,
// so a replica reads exactly what was made durable.
//
// Channels are keyed by a handle the caller chooses, not by the channel name: several
// BroadcastChannel objects may share one name (a publisher and a replica for the same database in
// one document, say), and each must be closable on its own without disturbing the others. A
// message posted through one object is delivered to every other object with that name, in this
// document and in others, which is exactly the fan-out wanted.
